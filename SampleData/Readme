This folder contains 4 files, all profiled by Adaptive Biotechnology and can be downloaded from immuneAccess (https://clients.adaptivebiotech.com/immuneaccess)
Files 1 and 2 come from early-stage breast cancer patients; 3 and 4 from healthy donors.

These files have been preprocessed from the raw data to save space: the TCR clones have been ranked in decreasing order by their abundance, 
and the top 10,000 clones were selected.

Run iSMART first to obtain the clustering file:

python iSMARTm.py -f sampleX.tsv

Then run DeepCAT to calculate cancer score:

python DeepCAT.py -f TestReal-sampleX.tsv-ClusteredCDR3s_7.5.txt
